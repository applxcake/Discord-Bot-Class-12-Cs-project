## üí° Introduction

Created by **Bala Adithya** and **Sri Ram Charan**, this project is a **CS project** for learning and showcasing our coding skills. This Discord bot uses **Python** and **MySQL** to create a simulated booking experience where users can:
- Book tickets
- Lookup flight details
- Cancel tickets
- Get support on various issues

This bot is a fun tool to engage users and can be used as a project in various CS-related curricula.

> **Disclaimer**: This bot is a fictional project and not intended for real-life ticket booking. It does not guarantee any real-world bookings or reservations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

To run this bot locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/flight-booking-bot.git
   cd flight-booking-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install discord.py mysql-connector-python
   ```

3. **Setup MySQL Database**:
   - Install MySQL on your system if you haven't already.
   - Create a database called `flight_booking` and add the following tables for bookings and flights:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE tickets (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       flight_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
   );

   CREATE TABLE flight (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       place VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       flight_number VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       delay VARCHAR(50),
       terminal VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

4. **Configure Database Connection**:
   - Update your database connection details in the code where the MySQL connection is established.

5. **Run the bot**:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

> Ensure you have a Discord bot set up and have its token ready to insert into the code. You can create a bot at the Discord Developer Portal.
